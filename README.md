### project is carried by Francisco Estevez, Williams Udofia & Nadav Ivzan as part of Fourthbrain MLE-11

### data was taken from the NASA/BoozAllen database: https://www.nasa.gov/content/prognostics-center-of-excellence-data-set-repository

### we ended up using a Long Short-term memory model with smoothing function

### We train the model on 4 different data sets and use the models to predict the response on the same 4 datasets
